#CNN+SVM:	
The notebook named CNN+SVM contains an implementation of a CNN model that utilizes categorical_hinge_loss for image classification. Due to the usage of categorical_hinge_loss, the last layers of the CNN acts as an SVM. To check the performance of this model, we conducted a few experiments, the report for which is provided as CNN+SVM.pdf.
