# CNN+SVM:
The notebook named CNN+SVM contains an implementation of a CNN model that utilizes categorical_hinge_loss for image classification. Due to the usage of categorical_hinge_loss, the last layers of the CNN acts as an SVM. To check the performance of this model, we conducted a few experiments, the report for which is provided as CNN+SVM.pdf. 

# Text-Classification:
The notebook named text-classification contains a code for performing text classification using logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and KNN. A comparison of the three algorithms is provided in our report named Text-classification.pdf

# MLP-from-scratch-vs-CNN:
The notebook named MLP-from-scratch-vs-CNN.ipynb implements an MLP model for image classification from scratch using only numpy (no DL library like TensorFlow or PyTorch was used.)
